## LIEPA synthesis dataset
Dataset ([read details](./liepa-synth.md)) contains audio utterances and phoneme transcriptions for 4 speakers.

### Getting dataset

To download and unpack locally dataset run following command:

> python get_liepa.py


### Clean dataset

To clean data integrity run following command:

> python clean_syn.py -a

### Fix dataset

To fix known issues in dataset run following command:

> python clean_syn.py -ax

## LIEPA recognition dataset
Dataset contains audio utterances and transcriptions for over 300 speakers.

### Getting dataset

> python get_liepa.py -nx

### Clean dataset

To clean data integrity run following command:

> python clean_rec.py -a

It should output file/directory naming issues, audio file framerate isssues and transcription encoding.

### Fix dataset

To fix known issues in dataset run following command:

> python clean.py -u -x

Will fix file structure.
The next command will fix all other issues including forsing wav PCM_16 encoding.
